# Conclusion

Throughout this project we were able to address all of our initial research questions. We saw that there were, in fact, two distinct spikes for two categories of opioids as the CDC claimed. Heroin and synthetics saw dramatic rises in overdoses in the years 2010 and 2013, respectively. There were small discernible differences in the rates at which different ethnic groups were afflicted, but the opioid crisis is an omnipresent issue for all races. We found that men are proportionally more likely to fall victim to a fatal overdose than women, with the exception of the American Indian/Alaska Native, which saw equal rates for both genders
