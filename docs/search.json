    "text": "1 Introduction\nEvery year about 100,000 people in the United States lose their lives to drug overdose[1]. The opioid crisis in our country has been a persisting issue for decades. Our goal with this project is to explore trends in opioid-related fatalities over a span of 19 years, from 1999 to 2017. Is ethnicity a major factor in drug overdose rates? What about age or gender? Can we discern which drugs were prevalent in different years? The CDC claims that this crisis has come about as a culmination of three distinct waves. First, in the 1990’s, prescription drugs such as painkillers became a prominent issue. Then, around 2010, there was a massive influx in fatal heroin overdoses. Finally, around 2013, deaths due to synthetic opioids such as fentanyl rose tremendously. Does the data provided by the CDC back up these claims? These are a few questions we are interested in answering.\nWe are also interested in exploring potential correlations with overdoses and other nation-wide trends. Does an increase in opioid abuse correspond to an increase in the national unemployment rate? Do overdose rates correlate with the cost of healthcare? We will explore all of these questions using overdose data from the CDC. We will compare this data to healthcare spending information from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services and national unemployment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n[1] https://www.cdc.gov/opioids/basics/epidemic.html"

    "title": "2  Data",
    "section": "2.1 Description",
    "text": "2.1 Description\nFor this project we will be inspecting four separate databases.\n\n2.1.1 Drug Overdose Death Rates\nThe first data source we will inspect is called “Drug overdose death rates, by drug type, sex, age, race, and Hispanic origin: United States”. This data set shows the rate of overdoses for different age groups, races, and genders from 1999 to 2017. This data set also breaks down the fatalities by drug type. These data are collected by the National Center for Health Statistics, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is an aggregate of public-use mortality files as well as U.S. Census Bureau national population estimates. The data are separated row by row for each demographic, year, and drug type. Each row represents a death rate. For instance, one row tells us that in the year 2017, about 1.6 out of every 100,000 females of American Indian or Alaskan Native descent died to a methodone overdose. This database was created in May, 2021 and was last updated in April, 2022. There are 6228 rows and 15 columns. One issue with this data set is that there are some redundancies. For example, there may be a row on death rates for black males and a separate row for black males (no Hispanic or Latino origin). This issue is easily resolved by faceting the data based on category breakdown. There are several ways to delineate categories, but the “STUB_NAME” column makes it easy to choose which category you would like to inspect (Age, Age and sex, Sex and race and Hispanic origin). By faceting using this column, no redundancies will corrupt the data. We accessed this data from the following web page- https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Drug-overdose-death-rates-by-drug-type-sex-age-rac/95ax-ymtc and downloaded the data set as a CSV file, which we then imported to RStudio.\n\n\n2.1.2 National Health Expenditure Accounts\nThe second data source we inspect is called “National Health Expenditures by type of service and source of funds, CY 1960-2021”. This comprehensive dataset shows how much money is spent annually on healthcare, both by the government and by the population. It includes dozens of sources, but we are mainly interested in out of pocket, private health insurance, medicare, and medicaid. These data are collected by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The NHEA measures annual U.S. expenditures for health care goods and services, public health activities, government administration, the net cost of health insurance, and investment related to health care. The data are presented by type of service, sources of funding, and type of sponsor. The purpose for including this data is to create visualizations that show potential relationships between healthcare spending and opioid abuse. Are people in need more likely to self-medicate if the government isn’t providing medical care? This dataset is updated annually. There are 541 rows and 62 columns. An important feature of this data is that the values listed are scaled down 1:1,000,000 so each item must be multiplied by one million to equal its actual value. We accessed the data from the following CMS web page- https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/historical and downloaded the data set as a CSV file, which we then imported to RStudio.\n\n\n2.1.3 Unemployment Rate\nThe third dataset used is the national unemployment rate. This data set consists of a list of years and the corresponding rate of unemployment for each month. These data are collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics through a nationwide survey for a random sample of the population. The database is updated monthly. There are 19 rows and 13 columns. We accessed this data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics from the following web page- https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet. The website has a handy UI that allows users to select a time frame of years to inspect and download. For our purposes, we selected 1999 to 2017 and exported the data as a XLSX file. The download included some extraneous titles and comments in the XLSX file, so we manually deleted those before importing the numerical data to RStudio.\n\n\n2.1.4 US Population Database\nThe fourth and final dataset used is the national population. This data consists of the population of the United States for the 19 years spanning from 1999 to 2017. These data were collected by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, FRED from the World Bank. This Data is collected annually. There are 19 rows and 2 columns. We accessed this data from FRED via the following web page- https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/POPTOTUSA647NWDB This site lets the user select the years they are interested in and download only that information. From this site, we downloaded the data as a CSV file."

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nOur data will allow us to explore some of the potential relationships discussed in the introduction. It is well known that correlation does not prove causation, but with well-made graphs we can inspect trends within the data. One question that we asked is “is there a relationship between ethnicity and drug overdose?”. To answer this we can facet the overdose dataset by ethnicity and create graphs that display the death rates of different ethnicities next to one another. Another question we asked was “Does an increase in opioid abuse correspond to an increase in the national unemployment rate?”. For this, we could superimpose a timeline of the unemployment rate over drug-related mortality rates for working-age groups. Last, we asked “do overdose rates correlate with the cost of healthcare?”. To investigate this inquiry, we can use the healthcare spending database to show how much citizens must pay out of pocket for healthcare for a span of years, and compare it to fatal drug-abuse instances. Our general workflow will consist of asking a question, deciding which datasets will help answer that question, parse the datasets to extract relevant information, and finally generate a graph that will let us visualize a trend in the data."

    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\n\n2.3.1 Drug Overdose Deaths Dataset\nDownload Dataset\n\n\nCode\ndrug &lt;- read.csv('~/Downloads/drug_overdose.csv')\n\n\nFrom the graph below we can see that there is only one column that contains NA values. This column is called “ESTIMATE” and refers to the estimate of the number of deaths that occured due to drug overdose. There are around 1,100 NA values in this column out of a dataset that is around 6,200 rows. This is a significant number of NA values, but looking at why these NA values exist and exploring the other columns in the dataset that correspond to a NA value in ESTIMATE can help us understand why this number is high.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndrug_na &lt;- data.frame((colSums(is.na(drug))))\ndrug_na$row_names &lt;- row.names(drug_na)\ncolnames(drug_na) &lt;- c('na', 'column')\nggplot(drug_na, aes(x=column, y=na)) + geom_bar(stat='identity', fill='cornflowerblue') + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) + labs(x = 'Column', y='NA Values', title='NA values for each column- Drug Overdose Dataset') + geom_text(stat='identity', aes(label=na), vjust=-1, size=2) \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot titled “NA Count Corresponding to Drug Overdose Deaths by Demographic” we can see that a little over 500 of the NA values in ESTIMATE correspond to a value in the ‘STUB_NAME’ column with value ‘Sex and Age’. The STUB_NAME column gives us insight into the STUB_LABEL column and what demographic information is available for that row. As discussed earlier, the values in this column that correspond to a NA value in ‘ESTIMATE’ are represented in the data already. Therefore, even though the number of NA values for ‘ESTIMATE’ due to the ‘Sex and Age’ category looks high, the information has already been captured in the data previously.\nLooking at the other graphs, we can see that the missing values in ‘ESTIMATE’ do not stem from a single year or a set of few years, they are distributed fairly evenly among the years. Therefore, we are not losing too much information from one year compared to the rest. Finally, from the Age and Drug Type graphs we can see that more of the missing values stem form the “All Ages” category and the “Heroin” and “Methadone” categories respectively.\nIt is important to emphasize that the NA values in the data will not corrupt the results of our exploration once the dataset is properly parsed and faceted.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(stringr)\ndrug_na_sub &lt;- drug[is.na(drug$ESTIMATE), ]\n\nggplot(drug_na_sub, aes(drug_na_sub$AGE)) + geom_bar(fill='tan') + labs(x = 'Age', y='# of NA Values', title='NA Count Corresponding to Drug Overdose Deaths by Age') \n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(drug_na_sub, aes(drug_na_sub$STUB_NAME)) + geom_bar(fill='lightblue')+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+scale_x_discrete(labels=str_wrap(c(\"Age\", \"Sex and Age\", 'Sex and Race', 'Sex and Race (single race)', 'Sex, race, hispanic origin', 'Sex, race, hispanic origin (single race)'), width=10)) + labs(x = 'Demographic Category Breakdown', y='# of NA Values', title='NA Count Corresponding to Drug Overdose Deaths by Demographic')\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(drug_na_sub, aes(drug_na_sub$YEAR)) + geom_bar(fill='salmon') + labs(x = 'Year', y='# of NA Values', title='NA Count Corresponding to Drug Overdose Deaths by Year')\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(drug_na_sub, aes(drug_na_sub$PANEL)) + geom_bar(fill='sienna') + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +scale_x_discrete(labels=str_wrap(c(\"All\", \"Opioid\", 'Heroin', 'Methadone', 'Semisynthetic Opioids', 'Other synthetic opioids (Not including Methodone)'), width=10)) + labs(x = 'Drug Type', y='# of NA Values', title='NA Count Corresponding to Drug Overdose Deaths by Drug Type')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 National Health Expenditure Dataset\nDownload the dataset and perform basic preprocessing to format the dataset in a usable manner.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(data.table)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'data.table'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    between, first, last\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\nnhe &lt;- read.csv('~/Downloads/NHE2021.csv')\n\nnhe &lt;- transpose(nhe)\nnhe_new &lt;- nhe\ncolnames(nhe_new) &lt;- nhe[1, ]\nnhe &lt;- nhe_new\nnhe &lt;- nhe[-1,]\nrownames(nhe) &lt;- c(1960:2021) \nnhe$Year &lt;- rownames(nhe)\nnhe &lt;- subset(nhe, Year &gt; 1998 & Year &lt; 2018)\nnhe &lt;- nhe %&gt;% select(c(1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 281, 282, 284, 285, 286))\ncolnames(nhe) &lt;- c('Total National Health Expenditures', 'Out of pocket', 'Private Health Insurance', 'Medicare', '          Medicaid (Title XIX)', 'Total Prescription Drug Expenditures', 'Out of pocket-Drug', 'Private Health Insurance-Drug',   'Medicare-Drug', 'Medicaid (Title XIX)-Drug' )\n\n\nIn this graph, we plot the number of rows in each column in the dataset that are not NA.

However, there are clearly dramatic inclines for heroin (red line) and synthetic opioids (cyan line) on the specified years. So we can conclusively say that the CDC was valid with their assertion."

It is evident that men encapsulate the entirety of the “high” and “very high” severity bins, specifically white and black men (see light blue and purple flows in graph). This result could point to a systematic issue that causes men to fall victim to addiction. That being said, a sizable amount of American Indian/Alaska Native women rates fall into the “moderate” category. Why does this ethnic group have disproportionately more female fatalities than every other ethnic group? Perhaps marginalized ethnic groups don’t have as much access to preventative and/or life-saving measures.\nSee the Cleveland Dot Plot below to further explore potential gender and race based trends, subdivided by drug type.\n\n\nCode\ndrug_sr2 &lt;- drug_sr %&gt;% \n  group_by(Sex, Race, PANEL) %&gt;% \n  summarize(m = mean(ESTIMATE)) %&gt;% \n  ungroup()\ndrug_sr2$estimate_cut = cut(drug_sr2$m,breaks = seq(0, 18,by=4.5))\ncolnames(drug_sr2)[3] =\"PANELS\"\ndrug_sr2$PANELS &lt;- factor(drug_sr2$PANELS, levels = c(\"All drug overdose deaths\", \n                                                      \"Drug overdose deaths involving any opioid\", \n                                                      \"Drug overdose deaths involving heroin\", \n                                                      \"Drug overdose deaths involving methadone\", \n                            \"Drug overdose deaths involving natural and semisynthetic opioids\", \n                            \"Drug overdose deaths involving other synthetic opioids (other than methadone)\"), \n                          labels = c(\"All\", \"Opioid\", \"Heroin\", \n                                     \"Methadone\", \"Natural/Semisynthetic Opioids\", \n                                     \"Other Synthetic Opioids\"))\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndrug_sr2$Sex_Race &lt;- paste(drug_sr2$Sex, drug_sr2$Race, sep = \", \")\ndrug_sr2 &lt;- subset(drug_sr2, PANELS != 'All')\ndotplot &lt;- ggplot(drug_sr2, aes(m, Sex_Race, color = PANELS)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"Overdose Death Rate by Sex & Race for Each Drug Type\", \n          sub = \"Averaged Over Years 1999-2018\") + ylab(\"\") + xlab('Average Overdose Death Rate') +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 20, by = 4)) \ndotplot &lt;- dotplot + guides(shape = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 0.9)))\ndotplot &lt;- dotplot + guides(shape = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 0.9)))\ndotplot &lt;- dotplot + theme(legend.title = element_text(size = 8), \n               legend.text = element_text(size = 6))  +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12)) +\n  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"bold\", color = \"grey35\", size=10)) +\n  theme(plot.caption = element_text(color = \"grey68\")) +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'white', color = 'gray80', size=0.25),\n          panel.grid.major = element_line(color = 'gray80', size = 0.25),\n          panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = 'gray95', size = 0.1))\ndotplot &lt;- dotplot + guides(color=guide_legend(title=\"Drug Type\"))\ndotplot\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see the overdose data broken down by race, gender, and drug type. Our initial observation is that white men have incurred the highest rate of total opioid-related fatalities. After that, black/African American and American Indian/Alaska native males are about equal at seven fatalities per 100,000 individuals. This data backs up the findings discovered in the alluvial diagram above. What does this graph show us about the type of drug affecting each demographic the most? Well, five of the eight groups suffer the most from natural/semisynthetic opioid abuse. To see why this is so, revisit the heat map above. While other categories of drugs have become incredibly deadly in recent years, natural/semisynthetic drugs have been a persistent issue since the early 2000’s. On the other side of the spectrum, methadone is almost unanimously the least deadly drug among different demographics. In conclusion, every demographic suffers from some combination of the narcotic categories. Each breakdown may differ slightly, but addiction does not take mercy on any one ethnicity or gender.\nDoes age play a role in addiction patterns? Below is a set of bar graphs that illustrate the rates at which age groups fall victim to fatal opioid overdoses, faceted by drug type. These rates are averaged over the 19 year span between 1999 and 2017.\n\n\nCode\ndrug_age &lt;- drug %&gt;% drop_na()\ncolnames(drug_age)[2] =\"PANELS\"\ndrug_age &lt;- subset(drug_age, PANELS != 'All drug overdose deaths' & STUB_NAME == 'Age')\n\ndrug_age &lt;- drug_age %&gt;% \n  group_by(AGE, PANELS) %&gt;% \n  summarize(m = mean(ESTIMATE)) %&gt;% \n  ungroup()\ndrug_age$PANELS &lt;- factor(drug_age$PANELS, levels = c( \"Drug overdose deaths involving any opioid\", \n                                                      \"Drug overdose deaths involving heroin\", \n                                                      \"Drug overdose deaths involving methadone\", \n                            \"Drug overdose deaths involving natural and semisynthetic opioids\", \n                            \"Drug overdose deaths involving other synthetic opioids (other than methadone)\"), \n                          labels = c(\"Opioid\", \"Heroin\", \n                                     \"Methadone\", \"Natural/Semisynthetic Opioids\", \n                                     \"Other Synthetic Opioids\"))\n\ndrug_age$AGE &lt;- factor(drug_age$AGE, ordered = TRUE, \n                       levels = c(\"Under 15 years\", \"15-24 years\", \"25-34 years\", \"35-44 years\", \n                                  \"45-54 years\", \"55-64 years\", \"65-74 years\", \"75-84 years\", \n                                  \"85 years and over\", \"All ages\", labels = c(\"Under 15\", \"15-24\", \n                                                                              \"25-34\", \"35-44\", \"45-54\", \n                                                                              \"55-64\", \"65-74\", \"75-84\", \n                                                                              \"Over 85\", \"All Ages\")))\n\nbar &lt;- ggplot(drug_age, aes(m, AGE)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = 'lightblue') + facet_wrap(~PANELS) +\n theme(strip.background = element_rect(color=\"black\", fill=\"white\", size=1.5, linetype=\"solid\")) +\n  ggtitle(\"Overdose Death Rate by Age for Each Drug Type\", \n          sub = \"Averaged Over Years 1999-2018\") + \n  xlab(\"Average Overdose Death Rate\") + ylab(\"Age Group\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12)) +\n  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"bold\", color = \"grey35\", size=10)) +\n  theme(plot.caption = element_text(color = \"grey68\")) +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'white', color = 'gray80', size=0.25),\n          panel.grid.major = element_line(color = 'gray80', size = 0.25),\n          panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = 'gray95', size = 0.1))\n\nbar\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst let’s take a closer look at the “Total Opioid” graph. The fatelity rates are approximately normally distributed around the age of 45, skewed toward older ages. After the age of 64, overdose rates fall dramatically. There appears to be an incredibly small fatality rate for children under the age of 15. Now let’s inspect age trends for each drug type. Interestingly, heroin and synthetic opioids are the largest issue for those 25 to 44 years of age, while methodone and natural/semisynthetic affect those who are 45 to 54 years old. In fact, natural/semisynthetic opioiods affect people older than 65 more than every other drug combined. Why does the distribution of fatalities among the different age groups vary by drug? We cannot answer this for sure, but perhaps knowing these distributions can help us to alleviate the opioid crisis by showing us where to direct preventative resources (highschools, colleges, workplaces, nursing homes, etc)."

The reason we chose this specific topic was by asking ourselves what external factors may cause individuals to abuse drugs. We hypothesized that people would self-medicate using narcotics more if the price of healthcare was too expensive. Below are two line plots, one which displays the average cost of healthcare per person, and the other which shows the average cost of prescription drugs per person. This information was calculated by extracting healthcare spending data from the NHE database and dividing by the US population for each year. The result shows how much money was spent, on average, by each person in the country.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tibble)\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gridExtra))\n\nnhe &lt;- read.csv('~/Downloads/NHE2021.csv')\npop1 = read.csv(\"~/Downloads/POPTOTUSA647NWDB.csv\")\npop &lt;- pop1\nlibrary(data.table, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\nnhe &lt;- transpose(nhe)\nnhe_new &lt;- nhe\ncolnames(nhe_new) &lt;- nhe[1, ]\nnhe &lt;- nhe_new\nnhe &lt;- nhe[-1,]\nrownames(nhe) &lt;- c(1960:2021)\nnhe$Year &lt;- rownames(nhe)\nnhe &lt;- subset(nhe, Year &gt; 1998 & Year &lt; 2018)\nnhe &lt;- nhe %&gt;% select(c(2, 4, 5, 6, 282, 284, 285, 286))\ncolnames(nhe) &lt;- c('Out of pocket', 'Private Health Insurance', 'Medicare', 'Medicaid', 'Out of pocket-Drug', 'Private Health Insurance-Drug',   'Medicare-Drug', 'Medicaid-Drug' )\n\nnhe &lt;- tibble::rownames_to_column(nhe, \"Year\")\n\npop &lt;- pop %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(everything(), as.character))\n\n\nnhe &lt;- bind_cols(nhe, pop['POPTOTUSA647NWDB'])\n\nnhe$POPTOTUSA647NWDB &lt;- as.numeric(nhe$POPTOTUSA647NWDB)\nnhe$`Out of pocket`             &lt;-  1000000*as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", nhe$`Out of pocket`))/nhe$POPTOTUSA647NWDB\nnhe$`Private Health Insurance`  &lt;-  1000000*as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", nhe$`Private Health Insurance`))/nhe$POPTOTUSA647NWDB\nnhe$Medicare                    &lt;- 1000000*as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", nhe$Medicare))/nhe$POPTOTUSA647NWDB\nnhe$Medicaid                    &lt;- 1000000*as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", nhe$Medicaid))/nhe$POPTOTUSA647NWDB\nnhe$`Out of pocket-Drug`              &lt;-  1000000*as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", nhe$`Out of pocket-Drug`))/nhe$POPTOTUSA647NWDB\nnhe$`Private Health Insurance-Drug`   &lt;-  1000000*as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", nhe$`Private Health Insurance-Drug`))/nhe$POPTOTUSA647NWDB\nnhe$`Medicare-Drug`                    &lt;- 1000000*as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", nhe$`Medicare-Drug`))/nhe$POPTOTUSA647NWDB\nnhe$`Medicaid-Drug`                    &lt;- 1000000*as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", nhe$`Medicaid-Drug`))/nhe$POPTOTUSA647NWDB\n\nnhe$POPTOTUSA647NWDB &lt;- NULL\n\n\n nhe_long &lt;- nhe %&gt;% \n   pivot_longer(!Year, names_to=\"Category\", values_to=\"Amount\")\n nhe_long$Amount &lt;- as.integer(nhe_long$Amount)\n \n  nhe_long$Type &lt;- with(nhe_long, ifelse(endsWith(Category, \"Drug\"), \"Drug\", \"General\"))\n\n\n\n\nxs &lt;- split(nhe_long,f = nhe_long$Type)\n\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(xs$General, aes(x=Year, y=Amount, group=factor(Category))) +\n         geom_line(aes(color=Category)) +\n        geom_vline(xintercept = \"2013\", color=\"red3\") +\n        geom_vline(xintercept = \"2010\", color=\"red4\") +\n        facet_wrap(~Type, scales=\"free\") +\n        theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'white', color = 'gray80', size=0.25),\n              panel.grid.major = element_line(color = 'gray80', size = 0.25),\n              panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = 'gray95', size = 0.1),axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1,size=6),\n              axis.text.y = element_text(angle=0, hjust=1,size=6),\n              legend.position = c(0.225, 0.9), \n              legend.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", colour = NA),\n              legend.key.size = unit(.05, 'cm'),\n              legend.title = element_text(size=6), \n              legend.text = element_text(size=6))\n\n\np2 &lt;- p1 %+% xs$Drug  +\n        scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,500, by=25)) +\n        annotate(\"text\", x=10, y=270, label=\"2010\\n heroin\\n spike\", size=3, angle=0, color=\"red4\") +\n        annotate(\"text\", x=17, y=315, label=\"2013\\n synthetics\\n spike\", size=3, angle=0, color=\"red3\") +\n        labs(title= \"Pharmaceutical Costs\",\n        y = \"Pharmaceutical Costs per Person\",\n        x= \"Year\")\n\np1 &lt;- p1 %+% \n        scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(600, 3400, by=200)) +\n        annotate(\"text\", x=10, y=2200, label=\"2010\\n heroin\\n spike\", size=3, angle=0, color=\"red4\") +\n        annotate(\"text\", x=17, 2400, label=\"2013\\n synthetics\\n spike\", size=3, angle=0, color=\"red3\") +\n        labs(title= \"Total Healthcare Costs\",\n        y = \"Healthcare Costs per Person\",\n        x= \"Year\")\n\ngrid.arrange(p1,p2, nrow=1)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have included vertical lines to mark the rise in heroin and sythetics in the years 2010 and 2013, respectively. One pattern that jumped out at us was in the year 2013, when the cost of private health insurance skyrocketed, both in general and in pharmaceutical payments. The NHE defines this category as “the net cost of private health insurance which is the difference between health premiums earned and benefits incurred”. Interestingly, the boom in health insurance prices in 2013 reflects a similar rise in synthetic opioid abuse. It is our contention that this inflated cost of care caused people to seek alternate solutions to medicate themselves, namely narcotics. However, correlation does not prove causation and these results may simply be coincidental. The other three categories (Medicare, Medicaid, and out of pocket expenses) do not provide us with any meaningful takeaways on the financial toll incurred by the population of this country.\nBelow we created two scatterplots to see if there is any discernible correlation between the cost of healthcare/pharmaceuticals and the overdose rate for opioids.\n\n\nCode\ndrug_all &lt;- drug[ which(drug$STUB_NAME=='Total'& drug$UNIT == 'Deaths per 100,000 resident population, age-adjusted' & drug$PANEL_NUM == 1), ]\ndrug_all &lt;- filter(drug_all, YEAR != \"2018\")\n\nexpenditures_drug &lt;- filter(nhe_long, Category == \"Out of pocket-Drug\" | Category == \"Private Health Insurance-Drug\")\nexpenditures_drug &lt;- expenditures_drug %&gt;% group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n                                 summarize(drug_spending = sum(Amount),\n                                 .groups = 'drop') \n\nexpenditures_all &lt;- filter(nhe_long, Category == \"Out of pocket\" | Category == \"Private Health Insurance\")\nexpenditures_all &lt;- expenditures_all %&gt;% group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n                                 summarize(healthcare_spending = sum(Amount),\n                                 .groups = 'drop')\n\ncombined &lt;- bind_cols(drug_all['ESTIMATE'], drug_all['YEAR'], expenditures_all['healthcare_spending'], expenditures_drug['drug_spending'], pop1['POPTOTUSA647NWDB'])\n\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(combined, aes(x= healthcare_spending, y= ESTIMATE, label=YEAR))+\n  geom_point(size=0.5, color=\"red4\") +\n  geom_text(size=2, hjust=0.5, vjust=1.5) +\n  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 15, breaks=waiver()) + \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,15,1)) +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'white', color = 'gray80', size=0.25),\n          panel.grid.major = element_line(color = 'gray80', size = 0.25),\n          panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = 'gray95', size = 0.1),\n          axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1,size=6),\n          axis.text.y = element_text(angle=0, hjust=1,size=6)) +\n  labs(title= \"Opioid Overdoses \\n vs. Cost of Healthcare\",\n       y= \"Total Overdoses per 100,000 People\",\n       x= \"Average Healthcare Costs \\n(Private Insurance + Out of Pocket)\\n Per Person\")\n  \n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(combined, aes(x= drug_spending, y= ESTIMATE, label=YEAR))+\n  geom_point(size=0.5, color=\"red4\") +\n  geom_text(size=2, hjust=0.5, vjust=1.5) +\n  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 15, breaks=waiver()) + \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,15,1)) +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'white', color = 'gray80', size=0.25),\n          panel.grid.major = element_line(color = 'gray80', size = 0.25),\n          panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = 'gray95', size = 0.1),\n          axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1,size=6),\n          axis.text.y = element_text(angle=0, hjust=1,size=6)) +\n  labs(title= \"Opioid Overdoses \\n vs. Cost of Pharmaceuticals\",\n       y = \"\",\n       x= \"Average Pharmaceutical Costs \\n(Private Insurance + Out of Pocket)\\n Per Person\")\n\ngrid.arrange(p1,p2, nrow=1)\n\n\n\n\n\nEach point represents a year in the time frame between 1999 and 2017.

Using the correlation function in r, we were able to determine that there is a 91% correlation between healthcare spending and fatality rates. We also determined that there is a 69% correlation between pharmaceutical spending and fatality rates. These trends may be coincidental, or they could point to a systematic issue within the United States healthcare system that neglects the less fortunate."

    "text": "3.4 National Unemployment Rate\nLast, we were interested in seeing if the national unemployment rate had any correlation with the rate of overdoses. According to research conducted by the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, “People who were unemployed were more than 16 times as likely to die by suicide as people with jobs” [1]. This being the case, we believed that there would be a positive correlation between the national unemployment rate and the overdose rate. Below is a scatterplot that compares the two rates, where each point represents a year from 1999 to 2017. This plot is interactive, so you can hover over a point to see which year it represents.\n\n\nCode\ndrug_year &lt;- drug %&gt;% drop_na()\ndrug_year &lt;- subset(drug_year, UNIT=='Deaths per 100,000 resident population, age-adjusted' & STUB_NAME == 'Total' & PANEL == 'Drug overdose deaths involving any opioid' & YEAR &lt;= 2017)\n\nunemployment &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Downloads/unemployment.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\nannual &lt;- rowMeans(unemployment[, 2:13], na.rm=T)\nunemployment$Annual &lt;- annual\n\ndrug_year &lt;- cbind(drug_year, unemployment$Annual)\ncolnames(drug_year)[16] =\"unemployment\"\ndrug_year$unemployment &lt;- round(drug_year$unemployment ,digit=3)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly, warn.conflicts = FALSE))\nsuppressPlotlyMessage &lt;- function(p) {\n  suppressMessages(plotly_build(p))\n}\n\n\n\nfig &lt;- plot_ly(drug_year, x = ~ESTIMATE, y = ~unemployment, marker = list(size = 10,\n                            color = 'rgba(255, 182, 193, .9)',\n                            line = list(color = 'rgba(152, 0, 0, .8)',width = 2)), \n                            text = ~paste(\"Year: \", YEAR, '&lt;br&gt;Unemployment:', \n                            unemployment, '&lt;br&gt;Overdose Death Rate:', ESTIMATE)) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = 'Unemployment vs Overdose Death Rate', \n         xaxis = list(title = 'Average Overdose Death Rate'), \n         yaxis = list(title = 'Average Unemployment Rate'))\n\nsuppressPlotlyMessage(fig)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial inspection shows that there doesn’t seem to be any discernible correlation between the unemployment rate and and the overdose rate. Using R, we have calculated that these two sets of data are 5% correlated (r=0.0497), meaning that an increase in unemployment doesn’t necessarily correspond to an increase in overdoses. While this may be the case on a national scale, it is important that we heed the warning of the Suicide Prevention Resource Center and offer support to our friends and families who are unemployed."
